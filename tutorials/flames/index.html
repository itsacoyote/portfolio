<p>A small and quick tutorial on painting flames. I was a bit low on my blood sugar so the painting is a bit shaky, sorry! ( Shows where I got my priorities :P )<p>
<p>The arrow in the image is to show the general area where I want my flame licks to start so I can have a bit of body to the flames below that arrow. It's good to start with a single line that forms the skeleton of a flame lick. From there I will pull down from the tip of the lick and expand outwards to build the body of the lick. For large flame licks I'll do it on both sides of the line, sometimes one outer edge is enough<p>
<p>With the first flame lick built up, I'll pick out another spot beside it to put another flame lick down. I like to alternate which way the flame is pointing, the skeleton line will help determine the direction. Don't worry about connecting the flame licks too much, just get the general layout and build of the licks. When you expand to build the body of the lick with the outer lines, those outer lines are what will connect between flame licks. As you can see, the arrow shows the general area where I want these licks to join.</p>
<p>Once the flame licks are joined, it may look a little sharp at the join. You can then smooth them out by painting over the sharp joins from flame lick to flame lick to give a more rounded connection.</p>
<p>Just keep continuing the same thing, building up more flame licks until you cover the area you want and finish it off by painting in the area. This is a quick and easy way of doing black flames.</p>
<p>This was done on paper using a size 3 Rosemary &amp; Co brush.</p>
